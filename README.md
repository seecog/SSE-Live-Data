# SSE-Live-Data
SSE Live Data with the help of nodeJs and angular2


Here we are using nodejs on the server side. Through server  we are pushing current millisecond timestamp to the client machine. With the angular2 on the client end we are consuming the data sent from server end .Thus we are getting live timestamp from server.

We have 2 folders here server and client. sever folder contains the nodejs files.


Running the server file.
Go inside the server folder and
1)run npm install
2)run node index2.js

Running client side
Go inside client/testingsse
run npm install
run ng serve
